# dashy-web
Yet another simple Web Application to track your todo, made using HTML, Javascript in its core with authentication and Database Storage being provided by Firebase and beautification by Bootstrap. It is hosted directly from Github with the use of Netlify. You can try the application [here](https://dashy.netlify.com/).

Dashy arose from my need to have a supporting web page to access the content/todo created from my Flutter mobile application. 

Dashy can add your todos, mark completed todos and even delete them once you are done with it. You can create an account using the traditional email and password combination or can use your Google account to log in. Also, you can add set up a username for your account. Todos created in the Dashy mobile application will be synced automatically with the web client once logged in with the same account. **Note** that if planning to use both the client and mobile application, Google login hasnâ€™t been enabled yet in the mobile application and hence use the traditional method for account creation.
